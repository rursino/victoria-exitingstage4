Provision of relevant Victorian COVID-19 statistics in relation to the criteria set in the Victoria Roadmap, which was established by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Features include:
- plot of daily Victorian cases.
- forecasts of the 14-day moving average and the most probable range of daily cases on any given day in the future.

This model predicted that, from late September, Victoria was able to move away from Stage 3 restrictions on the 19th of October, one week ahead of the target date set by the government. This prediction was made and publicly released on the same day the Victorian government shifted the target date by one week forward to the same date as the prediction made from the CoronaStats model.
